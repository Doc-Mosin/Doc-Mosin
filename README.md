Hi, I'm @Doc I'm a hobby programmer / developer and love working with HTML, CSS, PHP, Java and many other languages. I develop websites and scripts as a hobby and design logos and lettering. I work on discord bots and many other projects and am a big linux fan. I use different linux reps on my 2 and 3 pcs.

Most of the time I develop these things for myself and therefore most of the stuff on my GitHub page is also private.

I'm a passionate DayZ Hardcore Player, DayOne fanboy and modder and love music. My great love is Namalsk since ArmA 2 DayZ Mod days at the earliest. I only play on Vanilla / Vanilla+ and First Person Servers the 3PP, Unlimited Stamina, Trader etc are bullshit for me.

As mentioned, everything here is very private and therefore there is actually nothing interesting to find here.
